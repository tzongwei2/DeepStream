## DeepStream Examples
The following are very basic samples demonstrating how to use NVIDIA deeptream. To build more complex apps, custom plugin creation and linking, and more advanced sample apps please refer to NVIDIA's Deepstream Sample Python Apps here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps

* Deepstream1 - Simple deepstream pipeline using single line parse launch 

## DeepStream App
DeepStream App is an extremely fast development framework that allows you to create a VA pipeline in less than 10mins with 0 code (not exeggerating). However It is not as flexible as building your own pipeline in python. DeepStream App has in built ROI, line crossing, people counting, and more. IT also supports multi source, multi sink, and RTSP Output.
